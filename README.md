## I'm currently working on
Chemical Sensing:
- Novel architectures for multitask learning + early classification of time series
- Optimized preprocessing
- Learning from  [Samples Worth Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02565)

Molecular Representations:
- [VicReg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04906) over molecular images for augmentation-invariant embeddings
- [Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02835) over 3D molecular structure for unsupervised property embeddings

## I'm interested and have ongoing projects in
- Graph contrastive representation learning
- Sequential representations of time series
