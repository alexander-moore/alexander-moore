### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm currently working on
Chemical sensing:
- Novel architectures
- Optimized preprocessing
- Learning from  [Samples Worth Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02565)

## I'm interested and have ongoing projects in
- Self-supervised learning
- Representation / image compression learning for natural images
