### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm currently working on
Chemical sensing:
- Novel architectures,
- Optimized preprocessing
- Learning from  [Samples Worth Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02565){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

## I'm interested and have ongoing projects in
- Self-supervised learning
- Representation learning for natural images
- Image compression algorithms
